## Hardware Requirements
 
### Bill of Materials

The table below outlines the hardware components used in this project. Exact component matches are not required, and suitable alternatives will yield comparable results. However, as the software has been developed specifically for the Raspberry Pi, it is strongly recommended to retain this as the target platform.
 
| Component | Part Number | Quantity | Approx. Cost (unit)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Pi 5 8GB | 1 | £161.53 |
| Adafruit ADS1115 | 1085 | 1 | £11.18 |
| Adafruit TLC59711 | 1455 | 1 | £6.73 |
| Spectra Symbol Flex Sensor FLX| FLX-L-055-123-MP | 4 | £8.51 |
| Tactile Switch, 4.3mm, 160g | MCDTS2-1N| 4 | £0.17 |
| Kingbright L-7113IT 5mm 2V Red LED 80mcd | 56-0250 | 8 | £0.08 |
| Pisugar S Plus 5000 mAh Raspberry Pi UPS | Pisugar S Plus | 1 | $29.99 |

A MIDI-receiving device is required to complete the setup, either a hardware synthesiser or a software synthesiser running on a connected laptop. In this project, a Roland JD-Xi synthesiser was used, receiving MIDI directly from the Raspberry Pi over USB-B.

## Software Requirements

### Toolchain
Our build system is CMake, but we provide a simple top-level Makefile to make things easy. Feel free to run the `cmake` commands manually if you are so inclined. The `install-deps.sh` script will automatically install dependencies required by DigitSynth. 

## Installing
A simple install can be performed using the `.deb` package in the latest release. Download `digitsynth-aarch64.deb`, then run ```bash sudo dpkg -i digitsynth-aarch64.deb``` in your terminal after navigating to the directory into which the archive was downloaded. The standalone binary can also be found in the release.  

## Building

### 1.1 Clone the Repository
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RTES-Group/DigitSynth.git
cd DigitSynth
```

OR 

### 1.2 Download the release
Find the latest release on the right-hand side of this page. Download either the `.tar.gz` or `.zip`. After downloading and navigating to the download directory: 

#### `zip`
```bash 
unzip DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx.zip

cd DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx
```

#### `tar.gz`
```bash 
tar -xf DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx.tar.gz

cd DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx
```

Simply run the `install-deps.sh` script:
```bash 
./install-deps.sh
```

### 3. Enable SPI on the Raspberry Pi:
SPI must be enabled before the project will run:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to: Interface Options → SPI → Enable
# Navigate to: Interface Options → I2C → Enable
```

### 4. Build the project:

```bash
cd application/
make
```

### 5. Run:
```bash
build/digitsynth
```

## Unit tests

To run unit tests: 
```bash 
make test
```

### Resistor Selection & Voltage Divider Justification

While the flex sensors used in this project have a flat resistance of approximately 12 kΩ (±20%), this value is not universal across all flex sensors. Be sure to check your datasheet before substituting.

**Sensor operating range:** The flat resistance sits in the range 9.6 kΩ – 14.4 kΩ. At full deflection (180°, 8 mm bend radius), the resistance increases by a factor of >4×. We measured the fully-bent resistance to be ~50 kΩ. This yields a total operating range of 9.6 kΩ – 50 kΩ.

**Voltage divider:** A fixed resistor of R₁ = 10 kΩ was chosen, with the flex sensor as R₂ and a 5 V supply:

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

| State | R₂ | V_out |
|---|---|---|
| Flat | 12 kΩ | 2.73 V |
| Fully bent | 48 kΩ | 4.14 V |

This gives a swing of 1.41 V — a usable and easily resolvable range for the ADC. The maximum output (4.14 V) also remains safely below the ADS1115 maximum analog input voltage of V_DD + 0.3 V = 5.3 V.

**ADC source impedance:** The worst-case source impedance seen by the ADC occurs when the flex sensor is at maximum resistance:

$$R_{source} = R_1 \| R_2 = \left(\frac{1}{10k} + \frac{1}{50k}\right)^{-1} = 8.33\ k\Omega$$

The ADS1115 is a delta-sigma ADC with an input impedance in the range of 10–22 MΩ (depending on PGA gain setting). At 8.33 kΩ, the source impedance is more than three orders of magnitude below this, making its effect on measurement accuracy negligible.

The ADC automatically determines the minimum and maximum voltages, allowing the voltage range to be suitably scaled to the flex sensor.

/**
 * Base class for LED patterns.
 *
 * Course guidance applied:
 *  - Each pattern runs in its own thread (Ch. 3) so it never blocks the caller.
 *  - Timing comes from a timerfd blocking read (Ch. 3.4), not sleep_for.
 *  - A std::atomic<bool> running flag lets the caller stop the pattern cleanly,
 *    and join() waits for the thread to finish (Ch. 3.3.2 / 3.3.3).
 *  - A std::function callback (Ch. 2.2.1) is fired when the pattern completes,
 *    so the caller can chain the next action without polling.
